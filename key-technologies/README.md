# Key Technologies
- Core database
    - Relational (Postgres)
        - SQL joins
        - Indexes
        - RDBMS transactions (grouping multiple operations together)
    - NoSQL databases (DynamoDB, Cassandra)
        - Key-value, document, column-family, graph
        - Flexible datamodels, scalability, handling big data, real-time web apps
        - Consistency models (strong -> eventual consistency)
        - Indexing (B-tree, Hash)
        - Horizontal scaling
    - Blob storage (S3, Google cloud)
        - Large, unstructured blobs of data
        - Upload blob, returns a URL which can be used to download the blob.
- Search-optimized database (elasticsearch)
    - Search through a large amount of text and find relevant results
    - Inverted indexes: maps from words -> documents containing them
    - Tokeninzation: break text into words
    - Stemming: reduce words into root form
    - Fuzzy search
    - Horizontal scaling

- API gateway (AWS API gateway)
    - Route incoming services to backend

- Load balancer (AWS Elastic Load Balancer)
    - Distribute traffic across multiple machines
    - L4/L7 load balancer
        - persistent connections (websockets), L4
        - L7: great flexibility to routing trafic while milizing connection load

- Message queue (Kafka)
    - Examples:
        - Buffer for bursty traffic
        - Distribute work across a system
    - Message ordering: FIFO
        - Kafka allows for more complex ordering
    - Retry mechanism
        - Retires, delay between attempts (exponential backoff), max attempts
    - Dead letter queue: store messages that cannot be processed
    - Scaling with partitions
    - Backpressure

- Streams (Kafka)
    - Examples
        - Process vast amount of data in real-time 
        - Complex processing scenarios (event sourcing)
        - Support multiple consumers reading the same stream
    - Scaling with partitioning
    - Multiple consumer groups
    - Replication
    - Windowing
- Distributed locks 
- Distributed cache
- Content delivery network (CDN)
