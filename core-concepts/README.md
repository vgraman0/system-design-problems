# Core Concepts

- Networking
    - Network layer (IP)
    - Transport layer (TCP, UDP)
    - Application layer (HTTP)
- API Design 
    - Primarily REST basics
    - GET, POST
- Data Modeling
    - Relational vs non-relational
    - For relational, normalization/denormalization (splitting data across tables to avoid duplication)
- Database Indexing
    - Speed up database queries
    - B-tree (generally included with relational databases)
    - Hash indexes for exact matches, but can't do range queries
- Caching
    - Cache hit on redis: 1ms, Database query: 20-50ms
    - Complexity: invalidation, cache failures
    - CDN caching
- Sharding
    - After hitting storage limits, split data across multiple database servers
    - Hash-based sharding -> consistent hashing
- Consistent Hashing
    - Distributed caches, sharded databases
    - Avoid moving data when increasing number of partitions
- CAP Theorem
    - Consistency: all nodes see the same data
    - Availability: every request gets a response
    - Partition tolerance: system works even when network connections fail between nodes
    - Network partitions are unavoidable in distributed systems, so **always choosing between consistency and availability**
    - Strong consistency vs eventual consistency
- Napkin Math
    - Math that influences design decisions:
        - "Should we shard the database?"
        - "Can a single Redis instance handle the load?"
